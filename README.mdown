# People likes to think synchronously. Computers must work asynchronously. #

Impressed with excelent
David Beazley [python coroutines](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/) course, 
I wrote PyQt4 based coroutines scheduler.

You could write PyQt asynchronous code in the synchronous manner:

    # Coroutine is a special python function/generator with yield's,
    # where we could trap execution and process qt events.
    def sqlInserter( aLotOfrecords ):
        try:
            for record in aLotOfrecords:
                # do small piece of work here 
                ...
    
                # Let qt event loop to process pending events.
                #
                # This is not QCoreApplication.processEvents()!
                # We will return to the main qt event loop.
    
                yield
        except:
            # handle all exceptions in synchronous manner!
            ...
    
    
    # create scheduler and run coroutine as task
    s = Scheduler()
    # When we wrote 'sqlInserter(records)' we create Generator object.
    # This is NOT FUNCTION CALL.
    #
    # Execution will be started after first scheduler timer tick.
    s.newTask( sqlInserter(records) )



In addition to subcoroutines and system call ideas,
I added 'yield Return(..)' pattern.


    def subcoroutine():
        ...
        yield Return( myWork )
    
    
    def task():
        value = yield subcoroutine()
        ...
